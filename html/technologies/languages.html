                <hr><p2>Assembly Language<br></p2><hr>
                My first experience of microprocessors and digital electronics was at university during my engineering degree.
                My final year project involved working on an Intel 8048 processor.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-48"><p3><u>
                (ref. Intel MCS-48)</u></p3></a>. The development environment was Daisy DNIX <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Systems"><p3><u>
                (ref. Daisy DNIX)</u></p3></a>. This gave me an introduction to modular design techniques and embedded software debugging.<br><br>

                My next influential experience was when I began working with Telecom NZ. <a href="../industries/telecomms.html"><p3><u>
                (ref. Telecommmunications)</u></p3></a> I worked for four years on a very large scale 32-bit assembly language NEAX-61E
                <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/64147"><p3><u>(ref. NEAX-61E)</u></p3></a> telephone exchange platform. The software was 
                modular and highly complex. My role was to implement features now taken for granted such as CENTREX <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrex"><p3><u>(ref. CENTREX)</u></p3></a>, three-way calling, call waiting, 
                call diversion, network handover tones.<br><br> 

                We used a proprietary NEC operating system with task control, inter-task messaging, priority queuinmg and the concepts of context switching. 
                Being a safety critical system meant strict adherence to the SDLC beginning with thoroughly reviewed and documented designs, implementations 
                and unit tests. These went on to multiple forms of testing such as 'Soak', 'Stability', 'Integration' and finally 'Customer Acceptance'.
                <br><br>

                I was to take this experience and apply it in my next role working for Tait Electronics on the Motorola processors for their conventional 
                and trunked radios. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68HC11"><p3><u>(ref. Motorola 68HC11)</u></p3></a>

                <hr><p2>Embedded C<br></p2><hr>
                I first began using Embedded C under an in-house mentorship program at Tait Electronics. As part of the new product development team 
                I was trained in the intracacies of the language with a particular focus on Object Oriented Analysis.<br><br>
                
                Since this time I have only ever used C as my primary language. I have employed the OOA and OOD techniques I learned during this 
                development in all of my subsequent projects and have found it to be extremely useful particularly with respect to portability, 
                maintainability and comprehensibility. All this came at a small sacrifice of code space and execution time which by now was becoming less of 
                an issue as processors became faster and more powerful. I have been able to debug easily and communicate designs clearly via the 
                source code alone (though not without appropriate documentation).

                <hr><p2>C# MVVM<br></p2><hr>
                My introduction to C# has been relatively recent. I am very much a novice. However, I was given the opportunity whilst working for an automotive
                testing house, to manage a small team of Windows developers implementing a GUI for communicating with CANBUS decoders. I was able to 
                teach myself the basics of the language by piggy-backing off their code and implementing basic interpreter code at the low level board interface.
                This was my first exposure to the concept of object oriented programming languages. <br><br>

                Following this I have used C# to allow me to provide simulated graphical interfaces to other products via serial comms allowing me to 
                interact with prototype hardware in it's early stages of development. However, it is very much a 'tool' for me which I like to call upon
                when necessary during my normal embedded development.
