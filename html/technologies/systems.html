                The <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/64147 "><p3><u>NEAX-61E</u></u></p3></u></a> was my introduction to working with an
                embedded operating system. It was created by NEC to manage the telephone switches they produced for their global customers of which 
                Telecom NZ was one. I worked for four years with this product and learned a great deal about buffer management, message queues and 
                intertask communication. Having been implemented completely in assembler was quite an extraordinary feat.<br><br>

                <p2>Linux</p2><hr>
                Although I am not an expert, I have worked in and around Linux operating systems on a number of projects. This has 
                involved working in Linux distribution environments (via VM) as well as native linux for embedded systems. I have used 
                MinGW and Cygwin to utilise linux toolchains within Windows IDEs. I am familiar with various of the Linux utilities including GDB
                and bash scripts.<br><br>

                <a href="https://ecos.sourceware.org/"><p3><u>ECOS</u></u></p3></u></a>
                was used on the next generation <a href="../projects/mobile.html"><p3><u>mobile radio platform</u></u></p3></u></a> I worked on. 
                The project duration was two years, during which time I implemented code within various layers of the SW stack. I became 
                familiar with the associated inter-task messaging this entailed paying particular attention to thread safety.<br><br>

                is a Mcrium based embedded operating system that was used on the <a href="../projects/scada.html"><p3><u>SCADA radio</u></u></p3></u></a> 
                project I was involved in.  The project duration was five years, during which time I implemented driver and network layer code as 
                referred to by the link above. Real time performance was critical in my area of responsibility, necessitating deep consideration of 
                the OS and related thread performance.

                <p2>Own built task scheduler - (Attempt 1.)</p2><hr>
                While working on a new product development (<a href="../projects/oven.html"><p3><u>Oven Controller</u></u></p3></u></a>)
                I was afforded the luxury of developing my own scheduler for the first time. I was able to leveraged the knowledge I had gained in other 
                projects to date. I created message structures and layered the code in such a way as to prioritise the execution of short threads. 
                Luckily the realtime performance was not highly critical so pre-emption was not necessary. Having multiple stacks and task switching would have
                been my next goal.<br><br>

                <p2>Own built task scheduler - (Attempt 2.)</p2><hr>
                When I worked at <a href="../projects/exm.html"><p3><u>Johnson Controls</u></u></p3></u></a> I was given full license to write my 
                own scheduler. This was necessary as meeting SIL2 requirements required us to avoid off-the-shelf libraries. It gave me the chance to 
                build on my first attempt (as outlined above). Adding performance measurement code gave me the chance to finely tune its behaviour thus 
                keeping threads short and fast. I am quite proud of what I achieved during this implementation and consider it to be a highlight for me 
                in this project.<br><br><hr>
