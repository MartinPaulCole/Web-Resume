                Fire suppression technology has advanced a great deal over the years. It utilises a huge number of extinguishing
                system design types depending on the area to be covered and the type of contents that require protection. These can be
                valuable document storage, manufacturing plants or computer server systems. Extinguishing methods can be via basic 
                water sprinklers or, in many cases, highly toxic gases.
                <br><br>
                Working in the United Kingdom for an international building services company I was able to learn about fire 
                extinguishing technology. This began with supporting a legacy detection and extinguishing panel and moved on 
                to developing the software for a new ground up solution. This comprised of a basic UI and main ARM-M4 controller 
                which communicated with various analogue sensors and actuators.
                <br><br>
                Adhering to British, European and German national standards, consideration was made for MISRA and SIL2 level
                software quality. 
                <br><br>
                Standards included:<br>
                - EN 12094<br>
                - EN 54                
                <br><br>
                We were able to bring the new extinguishing product to a stage where we were undergoing type approvals with BRE 
                testing house UK.
