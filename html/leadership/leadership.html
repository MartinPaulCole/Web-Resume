                As I have moved between industries and companies and my experience has increased within these respective
                environments I have gravitated naturally towards mentoring, planning, advising and, ultimately, 
                leading. Though it is not for everyone, this can often be an inevitability for many during the progression 
                of their careers (as well as other aspects of life in general).<br><br>

                I have very much enjoyed this and learned a lot during it. Feeling passionately about any subject
                that you have in common with others often results in a desire to others learn and grow within it.
                Being able to take the lead in this process is a privelege that is definitely to be appreciated 
                (though not taken for granted).<br><br>
                
                My preferences are more by way of technical leadership as opposed to personnel management, 
                however I understand there is a cross-over between these and believe both require similar skills.<br><br> 

                Each technology, program, project, team size and team dynamic can be different but I believe there are 
                areas of commonality that can direct leadership style.<br><br>
                
                At the risk of sounding hackneyed, the following are thoughts and ideas I have formulated by observing good 
                and bad leaders (as well as being both). Watching how people react to these styles (as well as being aware
                 of my own reactions) has given me an insight into what the traits of good leadership can be.<br><hr>

                <ul><p3>
                    <li>Good leaders are good followers</li>
                    <li>Understanding differences between individuals</li>
                    <li>Understanding people's motivations</li>
                    <li>Getting to know people's strengths and weaknesses</li>
                    <li>Being aware of your own strengths and weaknesses</li>
                    <li>Being adaptable</li>
                    <li>Let people make mistakes</li>
                    <li>Learn from other people's experience</li>
                    <li>Knowing when to intervene</li>
                    <li>Shield your team from outside pressure</li>
                    <li>Agree mutual goals and ensure they align with the company goals</li>
                    <li>Set goals that are just a little out of reach</li>
                    <li>Celebrate success, celebrate success, celebrate success </li>      
                    <li>Plan, plan and plan again</li>
                </p3></ul>
