                Electronic funds transfer at point of sale is an electronic payment system involving electronic 
                funds transfers based on the use of payment cards, such as debit cards or credit cards, at payment 
                terminals located at points of sale. EFTPOS technology was developed during the 1980s.

                In Australia and New Zealand, it is also the brand name of a specific system used for such payments; 
                these systems are country-specific and do not interconnect. Other countries use different brand names 
                for their EFTPOS systems, such as NETS in Singapore. Since the early 2010s, country specific EFTPOS 
                systems have been overtaken by global EMV based systems with contactless payments or QR code payment 
                systems.

                The payment cards used by EFTPOS systems are plastic cards complying with ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard 
                that have a bank card number conforming with the ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard.<hr>
