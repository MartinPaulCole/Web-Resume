            <hr>
            Working for an international building services company I was able to learn about fire extinguishing technology.
            This began with supporting a legacy detection and extinguishing panel and moved on to developing the software for 
            a new ground up solution. This comprised of a basic UI and main ARM-M4 controller which communicated with various 
            analogue sensors and actuators.<hr>
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://wahdatechnique.com/produit/tyco-fast2000-fire-alarm-and-extinguishing-panels-modules/"><p3>
            <p2>Tyco FAST2000® Extinguishing Panels & Modules</p2></a><br>
            The FAST2000/2 is a range of fire detection and extinguishing control panels for small, medium and large 
            installations in industrial and commercial applications.<br><br>

            The FAST2000 is based on the latest Tyco PBS Technology and conforms to EN54-2/-4 standard for Fire Alarm Panels, EN12094-1 
            standard for extinguishing control systems and the VdS Guidelines.<br><br>

            One separate microprocessor for each extinguishing area controls the complex procedures between the intelligent analogue 
            fire detectors and the control outputs that trigger alarms and extinguishing actions. Another microprocessor handles the 
            control of the display and the internal communication.<br><br>

            At first the panel used detectors from <a href=" (https://systemsensoreurope.com/)"><p3><u>System Sensor.</u></p3></a>
            Later, in-house developed sensors were used instead communicating via proprietary protocol.
            <br><br>
            <p2>EXM851 Extinguishing Panel</p2><br>
            A new extingushing module was designed to replace the FAST2000. This was to implement only the extinguishing feature
            and would communicate to an existing more up to date fire panel using MX protocol designed for other loop-connected devices.<br><br>
            
            An NXP ARM M4 processor was used to implement the actuator control (relays, valves, sounders) of a local zone.
            I architected the driver layers, system level scheduler and timers as well as the I2C driven UI.
            Initially I wrote a test mode interface for allowing board bring-up and test. This was first prototyped on an NXP OM13092 development board.<br>
            <img src="../../img/nxp.jpg" align="left" margin-right="2vw" alt="OM13092" padding-bottom="5vw">
            As the project progressed our team grew and I was involved more in the overseeing of the feature implementation.
            <br><br>
            Adhering to British, European and German national standards, consideration was made for MISRA and SIL2 level
            software quality. 
            <br><br><br>
            Standards included:<br>
            - EN 12094<br>
            - EN 54                
            <br><br>
            We were able to bring the new extinguishing product to a stage where we were undergoing type approvals with BRE 
            testing house UK.
