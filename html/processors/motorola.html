        <hr>
        The processors we used were Motorola MC68HC11 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68HC11"><p3><u>(ref. MC68HC11),</u></p3></a><br><br>
        Firstly we used 64k EEPROMs for storing code written in assembler. As the product and its eatures expanded we moved to 1MB external flash
        devices using page switching. Thw HC11 did not have complex peripherals so in order to generate FFSK we needed to drive a GPIO directly via 
        timed interrupt.<br><br>
        Orion Emulators were used for debugging. They acted as plug-in ROM replacements. We were unable to step through code, however, as the Orions only had the 
        ability to monitor the data bus and even then only in 64K chunks. Instead, we relied on trace outputs. This became difficult when using paged memory
        as we needed to select which page the code was in that we were tracing. Logic analysers were useful as an alternative to the Orions.<hr>
