                I began in the telecommunications industry by working on telephone exchange software for NZ Telecom.
                This was my first real experience writing for large scale systems. Being closely aligned with NEC Japan,
                the software development was highly structured and organised. Strict adherence to the SDLC was enforced. 
                This included rigourous design reviews, testing and documentation phases for all new features.
                <br><br>                
                Following my time at Telecom I moved on to a mobile radio communications company. The original products
                were handheld and vehicle mounted devices used in public safety, utilities and transportation industries. 
                The products I first worked on were at a mature stage of their life cycle. I was able to move into team 
                leadership from this and managed the bug fixing and new feature development of these products.
                <br><br>
                As time progressed I was able to be part of a team involved in ground up redevelopment of these products.
                We were able to use the latest OOA and OOD techniques as well as what we had learned from the legacy devices
                to build on our collective experience and create a full suite of mobile radios ranging from basic conventional 
                to trunked base-station controlled systems.
                <br><br>
                Following a break from telecoms of a few years I joined a company team developing a new mulit-point SCADA 
                radio to complement their exisitng point to point high-speed data radio products. This was a new challenge 
                for the company and my role was to optimise channel throughput implementing the driver, MAC and network 
                layers of the software protocol stack.
