                My first experience of microprocessors and digital electronics was at university during my engineering degree.
                My final year project involved working on an Intel 8048 processor.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-48"><p3>(ref. Intel MCS-48)</p3></a>.
                The development environment was Daisy DNIX  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Systems"><p3>(ref. Daisy DNIX)</p3></a>. This gave me an introduction
                to modular design techniques and embedded software debugging.<br><br>

                My next influential experience was when I began working with Telecom NZ. <a href="telecomms.html"><p3>(ref. Telecommmunications)</p3></a>
                I worked for four years on a very large scale 32-bit assembly language NEAX-61E telephone exchange platform. The software was modular and highly complex. 
                My role was to implement features now taken for granted such as CENTREX <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrex"><p3>(ref. CENTREX)</p3></a>, 
                three-way calling, call waiting, call diversion, network handover tones. At this time competitors to Telecom were entering the market so we had to provide 
                routing and billing features to cater for these. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_Communications"><p3>(ref. Clear Communcations Ltd)</p3></a><br><br>

                We used a proprietary NEC operating system with task control, inter-task messaging, priority queuinmg and the concepts of context switching. Being a safety 
                critical system meant strict adherence to the SDLC beginning with thoroughly reviewed and documented designs, implementations and unit tests. These went on 
                to multiple forms of testing such as 'Soak', 'Stability', 'Integration' and finally 'Customer Acceptance'.<br><br>

                I was to take this experience and apply it in my next role working for Tait Electronics on the motorola processors for their conventional and trunked
                radios. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68HC11"><p3>(ref. Motorola 68HC11)</p3></a><br><br>
