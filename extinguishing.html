                Fire suppression technology has advanced a great deal over the years. It utilises a huge number of extinguishing
                system design types depending on the area to be covered and the type of contents that require protection. These can be
                valuable document storage, manufacturing plants or computer server systems. Extinguishing methods can be via basic 
                water sprinklers or, in many cases, highly toxic gases.
                <br><br>
                Working in the United Kingdom for an international building services company I was able to learn about fire 
                extinguishing technology. This began with supporting a legacy detection and extinguishing panel and moved on 
                to developing the software for a new ground up solution. This comprised of a basic UI and main ARM-M4 controller 
                which communicated with various analogue sensors and actuators.
                <br><br>
                I architected a software system utilising my own designed bare-metal scheduler which communicated via
                RS485, I2C and ADC to sensors and actuators for driving relays, switches, valves and sounders to enact
                the extinguishing process.
                <br><br>
                A further ATMEL processor was employed to communicated to the main control panel which was already in production.
                This used a proprietary protocol which was common to all other fire detection devices connected to a common loop. 
                <br><br>
                Adhering to British, European and German national standards, consideration was made for MISRA and SIL2 level
                software quality. I implemented a software test sub-system to enable hardware 'bring-up' and also created a 
                UI PC simulation tool to mimic the (as yet undeveloped) UI. This later morphed into an I2C driven LED panel.
