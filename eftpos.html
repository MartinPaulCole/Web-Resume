                Working for a Bangkok-German based software testing house I was able to experience
                managing a small team of highly skilled local software engineers producing the firmware
                and PC GUI software for interfacing and controlling multi-drop vehicle BUS communications data.
                <br><br>
                Our product was a PC application using C# - MVVM to display and decode CANBUS and Flexray messages
                detected on automotive control buses. We had a hardware team producing interface boards which
                connected to the ECU units of vehicles.
                <br><br>
                Our work was to provide a basic alternative solution to the existng VECTOR software products utilised 
                for testing by german car manufacturers.
                <br><br>
                We could decode and display control and response messages on the CANBUS interface as well as inject
                test messages to exercise various of the myriad codes being transmitted and received by the many 
                processors on the vehicle bus.
